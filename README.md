### Assignment Instructions:
Description:

This assessment is divided into two main components:

an in-class team presentation,
a written report.
 

1. Team Presentation 

Topic Overview:

Provide a summary of the chosen corporation's AI implementation strategies, addressing associated costs, such as:

Transaction volumes for AI services (e.g., API calls).
Token usage data (if the AI provider charges per token).
User adoption metrics (e.g., number of employees or departments using AI).
Highlight any evidence of “race to the bottom” pressures, focusing on how cost-cutting may affect ethics, quality, or long-term competitiveness.

Data Analytics Component:

Present visualizations that demonstrate cost projections, token usage, and potential ROI.
Apply the CRISP-DM methodology (particularly Modeling and Evaluation) to illustrate how data was analyzed and validated.
Recommendations:

Propose an initial framework for integrating AI in a sustainable manner, balancing cost-efficiency with robust governance and ethical considerations.
 

2. Written Report (Max 10 pages)

Introduction & Background:

Provide a brief overview of the chosen corporation and its industry context.
Data Analytics & Findings:

Offer a detailed analysis of AI-related costs, such as token billing, infrastructure, and labor.
Compare these costs with industry benchmarks or competitor data, if available.
Summarize how each step of the CRISP-DM methodology contributed to your analysis.
Risk Assessment:

Discuss the potential consequences of adopting a “race to the bottom” strategy, including security, ethical, regulatory, and reputational risks.
Use data to estimate potential impacts or probabilities where applicable.
Proposed AI Strategy:

Provide specific recommendations for the responsible integration of AI, addressing governance, compliance, and quality control.
Suggest strategies for maintaining a competitive edge without compromising essential standards.
Conclusion:

Summarize key insights from your analysis and outline future considerations for the corporation.
 

3. Supporting Data Files (Optional)

Teams may include additional data files such as spreadsheets, dashboards, or visualizations (e.g., cost models, ROI projections) to support their analysis.
